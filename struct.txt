HIPPA-Compliant Medical Data Management System
Overview:
    This project involves developing a HIPAA-compliant medical data management system that ensures the secure handling,
userdata privacy, and integrity of sensitive medical information. The system will be designed to meet the stringent requirements
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). User can control who can access their medical data and can also revoke access.
